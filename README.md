As a university student, I am studying Software Engineer. I try to improve myself about software, graphics and technology without staying within the boundaries of the school.
My purpose here is to show you the projects I have done and to see my own development over time.
It is to benefit from the knowledge and experience of knowledgeable and experienced people.

I try to improve myself on platforms such as Youtube, Udemy, Kommunity, PatikaDev.
